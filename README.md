ninja-ide-zeitgeist-integration
===============================

This plugin allows Ninja IDE to log all the events related with file manipulation into the Zeitgeist Framework, which later can be accessed by multiple applications and used in various ways (e.g. Docky, a desktop Dock application, uses zeitgeist to show recent activity on each docked application).

For now, it only registers events when a file it's opened. Future release will add close and modify evens (open to implement other useful events tho).
